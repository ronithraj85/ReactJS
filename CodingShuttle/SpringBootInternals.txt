1. JVM starts → main() executes

2. SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args)

3. @SpringBootApplication is detected
   ├─ @SpringBootConfiguration (@Configuration)
   ├─ @ComponentScan
   └─ @EnableAutoConfiguration

4. SpringApplication object is created
   ├─ Determines application type (Servlet / Reactive)
   ├─ Sets up Environment
   ├─ Registers Listeners & Initializers

5. ApplicationContext is CREATED
   └─ IoC container is now ready
   ❌ No beans are created yet

6. ApplicationContext.refresh() is called
   ├─ Component scan registers BeanDefinitions
   ├─ Auto-configuration imports more BeanDefinitions
   ├─ BeanFactoryPostProcessors execute
   ├─ BeanPostProcessors are registered
   ├─ Singleton beans are instantiated
   ├─ Dependency injection happens
   ├─ @PostConstruct / init callbacks run

7. Embedded web server (Tomcat) is started

8. CommandLineRunner / ApplicationRunner execute

9. Application is READY to serve requests

“When a Spring Boot application starts, SpringApplication.run() creates the ApplicationContext, which itself is the IoC container.
At this point, no beans are created.

Then ApplicationContext.refresh() is called. During refresh, Spring loads bean definitions, executes BeanFactoryPostProcessors to modify metadata, registers BeanPostProcessors, and then instantiates singleton beans.

During bean creation, dependencies are injected, lifecycle methods are called, and AOP proxies are applied.

Finally, the embedded server starts and the application becomes ready to serve requests.”
